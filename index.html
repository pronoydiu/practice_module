            <h1>COLOMBIAN ROAST</h1>
            <h3>Coffee professionals often describe Colombian coffee as: <br> Acidic, having a high acidity that can
                leave
                an aftertaste.</h3>
            <p>Colombian coffee also has a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast of the
                coffee isn't
                actually related to the growth of the coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used
                to
                make both
                light roasts and dark roasts.</p>

                    <p>A blend of fine Latin American beans roasted to a glistening, dark chestnut color. Loaded with
                        flavor, balancing tastes
                        of toffee and cocoa, just a touch of sweetness from the roast. This coffee is our beginning, the
                        very first blend we
                        ever created for you back in 1971.</p>

                    <p>Colombia is mountainous and has many elevated terrains that contain great soil for coffee
                        to grow in. Along with that,
                        the whole country features the perfect balance of rainfall and sunlight. The temperature
                        there is excellent, perfect
                        soil and the exact right amount of rainfall.</p>
